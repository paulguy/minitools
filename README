Intro
-----

Currently small collection of random tools I've written that may be useful to others.

They're mostly for my personal use but there's nothing stopping them from working elsewhere and they're reasonably 
stable, but may not catch all possible error states or sanitize input, so be careful when processing untrusted 
data.  They'll all likely be command line programs so make sure you know how to use a command line, but some are 
simple as running in the same directory or you could even just drag a file in to it.

Python scripts may require at least python 3.x unless otherwise noted.


Tools Included
--------------
extoggs.py
Extracts OGG Vorbis files from Blockland's cache.db.  Just run it to get information on using it.

dc2iso.py
Reads a GDI file and outputs a ISO.  Specifically designed to work with Dreamcast images, though hasn't been widely 
tested so might not work on all images or ones with oddball protections.  Files output with this utility won't work 
immediately, however, they may need their LBA fixed.  Requires python 3.4.

fixlba.py
Takes an ISO file and an LBA offset and adjusts all pointers within the file.  LBA can be adjusted forward or 
backward with a negative argument.  Paired with the previous program, you can make mountable Dreamcast images that 
you can browse with any file manager.
